#Vooban.Freshbooks.DotNet.Api#
Long story short, this project is just a wrapper around the great [HastyAPI.Freshbooks](https://github.com/lukesampson/HastyAPI.FreshBooks) use to communicate with [Freshbooks](http://www.freshbooks.com) cloud accounting system.

## Goals ##
The goal for us is to ease developpement using Freshbooks for .NET users, while providing an API that can be used easily.

## Why ##
We are creating this because **HastyAPI.Freshbooks** is great, but you must have the [Freshbooks API](http://developers.freshbooks.com/) by your side in order to use it. Moreover, HastyAPI.Freshbooks uses dynamic objects that reflects 1:1 the xml content of the **Freshbooks API**.
